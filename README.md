# Voronoi-Inverse
This code will create a simple 3 vertex voronoi diagram. It will the proceed to calculate the vertices of the voronoi diagram.
It will also display  the voronoi diagram with the discovered vertices. 
It also stores all the points it considers for the vertex in each iteration in a file.
